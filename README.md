# Assembler Project mmn14
This project was the final assignment in the "System Development Labs" course at the Open University. I took it on with a partner each of us worked on a different aspect of the project. 

# Overview
The project itself is a sort of an assembly compiler. It receives an input file (or a few) in an assembly language that the course's staff defined, 
and it translates it to machine code according to the requirements that were set, again, by the course's academic staff. Then, the machine code is translated to a base-4 format.
Examples can be found in the "test" directory.
